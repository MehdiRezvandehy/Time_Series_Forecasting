# Time_Series_Forecasting
In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Time series forecasting is predicting future based on historical data such as finishing a friendâ€™s sentence or anticipating the smell of coffee at breakfast, or predicting stock prices to tell us when to sell or buy. In this notebook, time series prediction is first applied with supervised learning including linear regression, neural network, decision trees and random forest. Second with deep learning including recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Two realistic data [sunspots](http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/sndtotcsv.php) and [Total Energy Consumption in Alberta](https://www.aeso.ca/market/market-and-system-reporting/) are applied for this notebook. Python functions and data files to run this notebook is in Github.
